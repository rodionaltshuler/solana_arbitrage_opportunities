## Arbitrage opportunity monitor between on-chain and centralised exchange

The program that monitors a market in Solana network and the same market in any CEX in search for arbitrage opportunities across the 2 venues. Connectivity should be done via websockets to both places to get live updates and constantly assess the potential for arbitrage.


### Current Solution

#### Pair: SOL-USDC

#### On-chain venue: 
Raydium SOL-USDC concentrated liquidity pool
https://raydium.io/liquidity-pools
Pool-id: 8EzbUfvcRT1Q6RL462ekGkgqbxsPmwC5FMLQZhSPMjJ3

#### CEX: Binance

The current implementation connects to both Raydium CLMM on Solana and Binance via WebSocket, subscribes to live price updates, and monitors for potential arbitrage opportunities.****__
 
- **RaydiumClmmSource** subscribes to a CLMM pool account, fetches AMM config to get fee data, and derives a bid/ask price and liquidity at these prices within current tick. 
- **BinanceSource** connects to Binanceâ€™s `bookTicker` stream to get the latest best bid/ask prices.
- Both streams are merged, the most recent quotes are cached, and an `ArbitrageChecker` compares the two exchanges to detect price spreads exceeding a configurable threshold.

- Each detected opportunity is logged with timestamp, spread, and quote staleness.  


Output example:
```
[Arb] ts=1758105620456 staleness=11960ms | Buy RAYDIUM_CLMM @ 234.5436, Sell BINANCE @ 234.5600, Spread 0.0164, Fees 0.1255
```

### Pre-requisites

Currently, you need rust and cargo to run the program (main.rs), version used:
rustc 1.89.0
cargo 1.89.0

### How to run

```
cargo run
```

### Project folders

- *idls*: interface definition language) fetched for Raydium Pool using fetch_idl.sh.
- *src*: program code
 

### Improvements Required

1. **BinanceSource**  
   Current implementation only fetches the latest tick (`bookTicker`).  
   Improvement: integrate L2 order book stream instead, as this would be more appropriate for identifying real opportunities to buy/sell an asset and for evaluating available depth.

2. **Arbitrage checker**
   Currently we obtain max liquidity at bid/ask level from Raydium CLMM (within current tick).
   When we have same info from Binance, we need to add the smallest amount of these two to use as possible arbitrage trade size.
